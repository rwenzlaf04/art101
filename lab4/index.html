			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding & Problem-solving</h1>
			
			
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Practice thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping straight into coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It took us a while to organize the high-level steps of our every day task (Jumpstarting a Car). We were a bit confused by the precode tag as well. However, other than that we didn't run into many problems! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I have felt confident in my ability to complete the steps in this lab. My partner, Soriah, and I revisited past labs when we had small questions about standard things we know we had already done. We also used W3Schools to figure out how to use the precode tag.</p>
