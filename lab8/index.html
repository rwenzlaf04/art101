					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab my partner, Natalya, and I practiced writing anonymous functions and callbacks. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My partner and I encountered many problems throughout the process of writing this lab. We first tried to write our own function that would perform multiplication, but weren't able to write it properly in order for it to work. Eventually we had to write a function that was more similar to the example provided in the screenshots on the Canvas page for Lab 8. I also had some trouble linking my javascript to my html in the beginning. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This is the first lab where I feel like I haven't had enough instruction leading up to writing the code myself. I tried to follow what is presented on the Canvas page for Lab 8, but have had trouble getting my arithmetic function to run. Overall, I feel like my partner and I had to figure out a lot more things on our own for this lab. Whereas, in past labs there was more guidance. </p>
