			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types & Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we experimented with variables in javascript for the first time. We also practiced our html and css skills that we have been building upon each week.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We weren't sure, at first, how to link out javascript file to our html, but we fgured it out by trying different things until it worked. Aside from that challenge, my partner and I were both able achieve all the steps in this lab without much difficulty.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Upon reflection, I want to remind myself not to under-estiimate my abiility to figure things out or do somehting new. I was especially intimidated by javascript before doing this lab, but I've learned the basics now and am excited to keep on learning. Like 'step up, step back,' I think this principle can apply to my whole life. </p>
