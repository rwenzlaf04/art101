			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			
			<div class="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, our task what to create a function that depdends on conditionals. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The code for my button and text input box worked right away. However, it took me some time to understand the code for the sorting hat function. At first, my getElementById function was not working, so the output I was getting after clicking the button was "The sorting hat has sorted you into undefined." I then realized that in two instances I had used a captial G in the word get where I was not supposed to. After I made this change, my output worked properly! I had to do quite a bit of debugging for other elements as well.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was fun! I like the idea of using conditionals, as it broadens my capabilities with a website. It also gets me thinking about how to use conditionals for online games! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						
					Please enter your name for sorting:
					<input type="text" id="input">
					<button id="button">Submit</button>
					<div id="output">
