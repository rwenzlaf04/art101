					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment for the first time with writing functions that take user input, as well as manipulate a string.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>After trying to link my javascript file to my html, I found that something was wrong as the javascript was not showing on my website. I went through my html and javascrpit code to check for any typos and to debug. My javascript is now showing up on my website, and my window prompt is working. However, the return function is not working. I followed the instructions on canvas, though I am not sure what else to do.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This is the first lab where my partner and I have both gotten stuck and do not know where to go from the point we are at. It makes me feel incompetent and I don't like it! We plan on asking about the return function in our section and resubmitting.</p>
