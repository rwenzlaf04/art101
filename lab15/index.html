			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			
			<div class="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for the lab was to experiment with jQuery and AJAX. We had to find an interesting API to use on our website.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a slow start with this lab, since I missed the lecture where we talked in depth about APIs. I didn't know what an API key was. After going back to watch the lecture, and asking a new friend, Corey, in my section about APIs, I was able to follow the recipe on the canvas page, and create a working website. The first few times I clicked the Activate! button after I had debugged everything, the random dog images were not loading. They said 404 page not found when I went to their links in the console. I guess it was just those two bad links, though, as when I kept clicking the button the dog images started displaying. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was fun! I sat down, and I focused on nothing but debugging for a good thirty minutes. My friend showed me an API that generates random images of cute doggies, so that is what I used. I was able to fix all the problems I had with the API, and get the images of cute doggies to display on my website in the end. I am proud of myself for going back in after the fact and figuring this lab out. I am victorious!</p>
