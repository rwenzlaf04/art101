					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab my partner, Natalya, and I practiced using arrays and objects in javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I went through the steps of the lab without encoutnering any problems until I went about linking my javascript to my html file. I used the code provided on the Canvas page for Lab 6, but my javascript would not show up on my website. I tried to debug the javascript and hmtl, and found a couple of typos which I fixed. I ended up reaching out to a couple of friends who are into coding, and they reccommended looking closely at the name of the javascript file I wanted to link. I didn't quite have the name right, and once I fixed that problem it worked great. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of fun overall with this lab. I really enjoy using what I've learned in the past and combining it with what we learn each week. In this lab I have learned that it can be valuable at times to just try things. I had trouble linking my javascript at first, but figured it out by asking some friends and checking over and over again that the title of what I was trying to link was correct.</p>
