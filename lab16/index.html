			<div class="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Our challenge for the lab was to experiment with processing JSON with and API.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into two main problems with this lab. In section, my partner and I were confused about whether or not we needed an API key for this lab. After speaking with our TA, that confusion was cleared up as we did not need a key. The other problem I ran into was my image not displaying on my website. My other output (the text) did display, so I am not sure what is preventing the image from being displayed too. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was overall not super difficult! It was much easier than Lab 15 which I struggled with quite a bit. The only remaining issue I have is that I my image is not displaying. I will ask my TA about this in Friday's section.  </p>
