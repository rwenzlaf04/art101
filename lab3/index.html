				<h4>Bio</h4>
				<p>Hi! My name is Ruby. I like to draw and print things on clothes and cut up my clothes. I am learning to play the guitar. I want to learn Stand by Me on the guitar so that I can play music with my grandma during the holidays.

					<h2>Subject</h2>
					<p>We practiced editing html and organizing our files in the art101 folder. We also practied using class tags to create boxes around our paragraphs, as well as incorporating images into our website. Finally we practiced making bulleted lists, with the unordered lists tag, that can also be hyperlinks to other files in our art101 folder.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While editing my html during section, I accidentally took away one the boxes I had created with a div tag. I eventually figured out that the box had disapeared as a result of me forgetting an end tag on my image. After looking at my html with my partner and TA, we were all stumped, until I checked one more time and discovered the missing end tag on my image. I felt great about figuring this out on my own and remembering that the image needed an end tag! I am learning big time! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We were dedicated to the end product, and we worked on this lab in section and after section. This lab helped solidify our existing knowledge of html. For me, it especially reinforced my knowledge of class tags. I enjoyed working on this lab! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We were able to change the impact and look of our website using HTML and a little bit of CSS. We were able to achieve every task in the lab. </p>
