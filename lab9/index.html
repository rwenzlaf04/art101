					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At the very beginning of this lab, I had trouble creating my four buttons in each section of my website. My TA, Vibha, was super helpful in guiding me through the code for these buttons during section. Later on, my partner and I had a bit of trouble at first when trying to make our buttons do something, such as change the background color. However, after consulting our notes from the console work we did in class and rewatching part of the lecture from Wednesday of this past week, we were able to figure out the click function which made our buttons work. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had a lot of fun with this lab! I feel triumphant after having so much difficulty with the anon functions from Lab 8. I would still like to review creating buttons going forward, though, since without the guidance of my TA, I would not have been able to complete this lab. I can definitely see how creating buttons would be useful in making art or any other kind of website. The colors of my website turned out looking a bit Candyland-esque, and that has me thinking about web game design! </p>
